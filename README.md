# deliveryapp

A new Flutter project.


### Problem statement

Screen:- https://prnt.sc/jcoINdp51lmD
1) Create the collection and delivery date time functionality.
2) collection date time: user can select only one date for collection and also select
only morning or afternoon time slot.
3) Delivery date time:- user can select only one date for delivery and also select only
morning or afternoon time slot. But this delivery date time can not be same as
collection date time and it must be after collection date can select for delivery date.

Note:-
1) date must be dynamically Today, tomorrow and next day of tomorrow.

2) validation must be necessary if user can select same date or delivery date before
collection date so give the error(validation).

3) you can not use “setstate” for update value and it’s your choice to use any state
manegment.
